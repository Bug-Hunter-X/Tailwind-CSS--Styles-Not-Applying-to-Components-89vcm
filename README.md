# Tailwind CSS: Styles Not Applying to Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components.  The problem arises from an incorrectly configured `content` option within the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Issue

The `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` might not correctly include all the directories and files containing the classes you're using. This frequently results in Tailwind's JIT compiler failing to find and incorporate those classes, leaving your components unstyled.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that the `content` array correctly points to all relevant source files.  Carefully examine your project's structure and modify the array accordingly.
